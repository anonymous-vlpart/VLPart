# Prepare models for VLPart

VLPart uses two backbones including ResNet-50 and Swin-Base. The pretrained ResNet-50 model can be downloaded automatically by timm. 
We also provide pretrained [Swin-Base]() which are compatible with Detectron2. Please download them to VLPart_ROOT/models/ before training:


The trained models are in the [Model Zoo](../MODEL_ZOO.md).
